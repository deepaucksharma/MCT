## The 12 Core Experiments

### Week 1-2 (Foundation)
1. **Postponement Control Test** - "My worry is uncontrollable"
2. **Time-to-Refocus Drill** - "Once I start worrying, I can't stop"

### Week 2-3 (Belief Testing)
3. **No-Monitoring Window** - "If I don't monitor, I'll miss something dangerous"
4. **Checking Reduction Challenge** - "I must check or something bad will happen"
5. **Reassurance Seeking Fade** - "I need reassurance to cope"

### Week 4-5 (Belief Comparison)
6. **Plan-Then-Act vs Worry-First** - "Worry helps me prepare better"
7. **DM Micro-Intervals** - "I can't detach from important thoughts"

### Week 5-6 (Advanced Testing)
8. **ATT-Lite in Trigger** - "I lose all control when triggered"
9. **Allow-the-Thought Windows** - "Having worry thoughts is dangerous"

### Week 6-7 (Challenging Tests)
10. **Drop One Safety Net** - "I need [specific safety behavior] to cope"
11. **Content Timer Experiment** - "I must think things through completely"
12. **Stress Test Composite** - "I can't use MCT skills in real situations"

  week_number INTEGER,
  belief_tested TEXT NOT NULL,
  prediction TEXT NOT NULL,
  safety_behaviors_dropped TEXT,

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```typescript
import { ExperimentDashboard } from './components/experiments';

// In your main app component
<ExperimentDashboard currentWeek={userSettings.current_week} />
```

### Using Templates
```typescript
import { EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATES, getExperimentsByWeek } from './components/experiments';

// Get experiments for current week
const weekExperiments = getExperimentsByWeek(3);

// Get specific template
const postponementTest = EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATES.find(t => t.id === 'postponement-control');
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Create new experiment from template
const response = await fetch('/api/experiments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    template_id: 'postponement-control',
    belief_tested: 'My worry is uncontrollable',
    prediction: 'I predict I will not be able to postpone more than 2 worry episodes',
    week_number: 2,
    protocol_steps: [...],
    status: 'planned'
  })
});
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Structure
- Each experiment follows the Module 5 framework exactly
- Specific belief targets with measurable outcomes
- Clear success criteria and interpretation guidelines

### 2. Process Focus (MCT Fidelity)
- No content analysis or discussion of worry topics
- Focus on HOW thoughts are related to, not WHAT they contain
- Belief testing through experience, not logical debate

### 3. Systematic Progression
- Experiments build from easy to challenging
- Foundation skills (postponement, refocusing) first
- Advanced applications (trigger management) later

### 4. Quantified Measurement
- Before/after belief ratings (0-100 scale)
- Objective metrics where possible
- Clear success thresholds for interpretation

### 5. User Experience
- Intuitive step-by-step workflow
- Progress tracking and motivation
- Flexible scheduling and pacing

## Compliance with Module 5 Specification

âœ… **All 12 Core Experiments**: Complete implementation of every experiment from the specification

âœ… **Required Components**: Each experiment includes all required elements:
- Belief Under Test (specific statement)
- Prediction (quantifiable when possible)
- Safety Behaviors to Drop (explicit list)
- Protocol Steps (time, place, duration)
- Metrics (objective measurements)
- Outcome Recording (actual vs predicted)
- Belief Re-rating (0-100 before and after)
- Learning Statement (one sentence summary)

âœ… **Evidence Quality Standards**: All experiments are:
- Behavioral (not just thought-based)
- Measurable (numbers, not impressions)
- Repeated (multiple trials when possible)
- Specific (targeted to one belief)
- Fair (genuine test, not rigged)

âœ… **Proper Sequencing**: Follows recommended order and difficulty progression

âœ… **Acceptance Criteria**: Meets all individual and program-level success criteria

## Future Enhancements

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Aggregate data across all experiments
- **Personalization**: Custom experiment creation tools
- **Reminders**: Automated notifications for experiment steps
- **Progress Visualization**: Charts and graphs for belief changes
- **Export Features**: Generate experiment reports and summaries
