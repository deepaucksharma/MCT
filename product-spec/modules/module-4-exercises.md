# Module 4: Exercise Library (Scripted, Variants, Measurement)

## Purpose
Specify ATT, DM, Postponement, SAR exercises to a level that ensures consistent delivery, measurement, and MCT fidelity. Each exercise must be precisely scripted with clear measurement protocols.

## 4.1 Attention Training Technique (ATT)

### Goal
Enhance attentional control via selective, switching, and divided attention to external neutral sounds.

### Standard Track (12-15 minutes)

#### Audio Script

**Introduction (30 seconds)**
"This is Attention Training Technique. This is not relaxation or mindfulness. This is training for your attention. Sit comfortably with eyes closed or softly focused. We'll work with sounds in your environment."

**Part A: Selective Attention (3 minutes)**
"Focus your attention on the most distant sound you can hear. Give it your full attention... [30 seconds]

Now switch your attention to a closer sound, perhaps in this room. Focus completely on this sound... [30 seconds]

Now focus on a sound very close to you, perhaps your own breathing. Give it full attention... [30 seconds]

Switch back to the distant sound... [30 seconds]

Now to the room sound... [30 seconds]

And to the close sound... [30 seconds]"

**Part B: Rapid Attention Switching (4 minutes)**
"Now you'll rapidly switch attention between different sounds. Don't analyze, just shift.

Focus on any sound... now switch... switch again... another sound... switch... keep switching every few seconds... don't stay with any sound... just keep moving your attention... switch... switch... switch...

[Continue switching cues every 5-10 seconds for full duration]"

**Part C: Divided Attention (4 minutes)**
"Now try to expand your attention to be aware of multiple sounds simultaneously.

Be aware of two sounds at the same time... hold both in awareness... add a third sound... try to maintain awareness of all three...

Now expand further... be aware of as many sounds as possible simultaneously... the entire sound environment... all sounds together... maintain this broad awareness...

[Hold for 2 minutes]

Now narrow to three sounds... now two... now one..."

**Part D: Flexible Control (3 minutes)**
"Now practice flexible control. Narrow your attention to one specific sound... [20 seconds]

Expand to the whole soundscape... [20 seconds]

Narrow to a different single sound... [20 seconds]

Expand again to all sounds... [20 seconds]

Switch rapidly between three sounds... [30 seconds]

Now hold all three simultaneously... [30 seconds]

Return to single focus... [20 seconds]

And finally, let your attention rest neutrally, aware but not focused... [20 seconds]"

**Closing (30 seconds)**
"In a moment, open your eyes and return your attention to the room. Remember, you just trained your attention. This control is always available to you. Opening your eyes now."

### Variants

- Part A: 2 minutes (fewer switches)
- Part B: 2 minutes (rapid switching maintained)
- Part C: 2 minutes (divided attention maintained)
- Part D: 1-2 minutes (flexible control shortened)

#### Emergency ATT-Lite (90 seconds)
- 20 seconds: Identify 3 sounds
- 30 seconds: Rapid switching between them
- 20 seconds: Hold all 3 simultaneously
- 20 seconds: Expand to full soundscape

### Measurement Protocol

#### Post-Session Ratings

1. **Attentional Control** (0-100)
   - Prompt: "Rate your ability to control your attention"
   - Anchor: 0 = No control, 100 = Complete control

2. **Intrusions** (Yes/No + Count)
   - Prompt: "Did thoughts intrude during practice?"
   - If yes: "Approximately how many times?"

3. **Shift Ease** (0-100)
   - Prompt: "How easy was it to shift attention between sounds?"
   - Anchor: 0 = Impossible, 100 = Effortless

4. **Session Completion** (Percentage)
   - Auto-tracked: % of audio completed

#### Weekly Metrics
- Total ATT minutes
- Average control rating
- Intrusion frequency trend
- Completion rate

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User completes ≥3 parts minimum
- [ ] Post-ratings captured within 30 seconds
- [ ] No content discussion during or after
- [ ] Clear phase transitions in audio

## 4.2 Detached Mindfulness (DM)

### Goal
Observe thoughts as mental events without engagement, suppression, or elaboration.

### Core Protocol (60-180 seconds)

#### LAPR Method Script

**Label (15 seconds)**
"Notice any thought present right now. Simply label it: 'A thought is here' or 'Worry is present' or 'Planning is happening'. Don't analyze the content, just acknowledge its presence."

**Allow (15 seconds)**
"Allow this thought to be present. Don't push it away. Don't try to stop it. It's just a mental event, like a sound in another room. It can be there without your participation."

**Position (20 seconds)**
"Position yourself as an observer. You're watching this thought like:
- Words scrolling on a screen
- A cloud drifting past
- A train passing by the platform
You see it, but you're not involved with it."

**Refocus (10+ seconds)**
"Now gently redirect your attention to [chosen anchor]:
- Your breath moving in and out
- Sounds in your environment
- Physical sensations in your hands
The thought may still be there. That's fine. Your attention is elsewhere."

### Metaphor Variations

#### Radio Metaphor
"Your thoughts are like a radio playing in another room. You can hear it, but you're not listening to the words. It's just background noise while you focus on what you're doing."

#### Screen Metaphor
"Thoughts are like text scrolling across a screen. You see them passing, but you don't read every word. They move by while you attend to other things."

#### Weather Metaphor
"Thoughts are like weather passing overhead. Clouds come and go. You notice them but don't try to change them. You continue with your activities regardless."

### Practice Schedules

#### Standard 3x Daily
- Morning: With first beverage
- Midday: Before or after lunch
- Evening: Transition from work

## 4.3 Worry/Rumination Postponement

### Goal
Break automatic worry/rumination cycles through systematic delay and contained processing.

### Core Protocol

#### Detection Phase
**Prompt**: "I notice worry/rumination starting"

**Actions**:
1. Recognition without content
2. Immediate pause
3. Open postponement tool

#### Assessment Phase
**Urge Rating**: Slider 0-100
"Rate your urge to continue thinking about this"

**Categorization**: 
- Worry (future-focused)
- Rumination (past-focused)
- Mixed (both)

#### Scheduling Phase
**Decision Tree**:
```
Is this urgent?
├─ No → Schedule to daily slot
├─ Maybe → Schedule to later today
└─ Yes → 10-minute timer, then postpone
```

**Confirmation**:
"Postponed to [time]. You can think about this then if needed."

#### Refocusing Phase
**SAR Prompt**:
"Choose immediate refocus:"
- Count 5 [colors] around you
- Name 3 sounds you hear
- Feel 3 textures near you
- [Custom SAR plans]

#### Postponement Slot Protocol

**Opening** (6:30 PM default)
"This is your scheduled thinking time."

**Review Queue**:
- List of postponed items (labels only)
- Current urge for each (0-100)
- Compare to initial urge

**Processing Options**:
1. "Urge has passed" → Close without processing
2. "Still important" → 10-minute contained thinking
3. "Needs action" → 2-minute planning only

**Closure**:
"Thinking time complete. Return to your evening."

### Measurement Protocol

1. **Episodes Detected** (Count)
2. **Episodes Postponed** (Count)
3. **Success Rate** (Percentage)
4. **Urge Reduction** (Delta)
   - Initial urge - Slot urge
5. **Processing Time** (Minutes)
   - Time spent in slot
6. **Items Processed** (Percentage)
   - Items actually thought about vs dismissed

### Advanced Variations

#### 24-Hour Postponement

### Plan Builder Protocol

#### Step 1: Trigger Identification
"Select your triggers:"
- □ Work stress
- □ Health concerns
- □ Social situations
- □ Morning routine
- □ Evening wind-down
- □ [Custom triggers]

#### Step 2: Action Selection
"Choose refocus actions for each trigger:"

**Visual Actions**:
- Count 5 [specific color] objects
- Find 3 rectangular shapes
- Notice lightest to darkest gradient
- Track moving objects for 30 seconds

**Auditory Actions**:
- Identify 3 distinct sounds
- Count rhythm in background music
- Focus on furthest sound
- Create sound map of environment

**Tactile Actions**:
- Feel 3 different textures
- Notice temperature variations
- Tense and release muscle groups
- Trace patterns with finger

**Cognitive Actions**:
- Count backwards from 100 by 7s
- Name items in category (fruits A-Z)
- Spell words backwards
- Mental math sequences

**Movement Actions**:
- Walk and count steps to 50
- Stretch sequence (specific)
- Balance on one foot 30 seconds
- Finger exercises pattern

#### Step 3: If-Then Formatting

**Template**:
"If [trigger occurs], then I will [specific action]"

**Examples**:
- If worry starts at desk → Then count 5 blue objects
- If rumination in bed → Then name 3 sounds outside
- If checking urge → Then feel 3 textures nearby
- If reassurance seeking → Then backwards from 100 by 7s

#### Step 4: Practice Drills

**Drill Mode** (30 seconds each):
1. Imagine trigger mildly
2. Execute SAR immediately
3. Rate execution speed (0-100)
4. Repeat 3x for automation

### Measurement Protocol

1. **Time to Refocus** (Seconds)
   - Self-timed or estimated
   - Target: <30 seconds

2. **Success Rate** (Percentage)
   - Used SAR / Trigger occurred

3. **Effectiveness Rating** (0-100)
   - "How well did SAR break the CAS?"

4. **Automation Level** (1-5)
   - 1 = Required effort to remember
   - 5 = Automatic response

### SAR Library (30+ Options)

#### Emergency SAR (10 seconds)
- STOP acronym: Stop, Take breath, Observe environment, Proceed
