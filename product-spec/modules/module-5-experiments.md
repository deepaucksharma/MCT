# Module 5: Behavioral Experiments Library (Belief-Targeted)

## Purpose
Provide robust experiment templates to test metacognitive beliefs with measurable predictions. Each experiment must generate clear evidence for or against specific beliefs through direct experience.

## Experiment Framework

### Required Components for Every Experiment

1. **Belief Under Test** (Specific statement)
2. **Prediction** (Quantifiable when possible)
3. **Safety Behaviors to Drop** (List explicitly)
4. **Protocol Steps** (Time, place, duration)
5. **Metrics** (Objective measurements)
6. **Outcome Recording** (Actual vs predicted)
7. **Belief Re-rating** (0-100 before and after)
8. **Learning Statement** (One sentence summary)

### Evidence Quality Standards

- **Behavioral** (not just thought-based)
- **Measurable** (numbers, not impressions)
- **Repeated** (multiple trials when possible)
- **Specific** (targeted to one belief)
- **Fair** (genuine test, not rigged)

## Core Experiment Set (12 Templates)

### 1. Postponement Control Test

**Target Belief**: "My worry is uncontrollable"

**Hypothesis**: If worry is truly uncontrollable, I won't be able to postpone it.

**Protocol**:
```
Day 1-3:
- Detect 3+ worry episodes daily
- Rate initial urge (0-100)
- Postpone to evening slot
- Rate urge at slot (0-100)
- Track: Did worry return to awareness before slot?
```

**Metrics**:
- Postponement success rate (%)
- Average urge reduction (points)
- Episodes forgotten entirely (%)

**Interpretation**:
- >60% success = Evidence of control
- >20 point urge reduction = Natural decay
- >30% forgotten = Not as important as felt

**Common Outcome**: "I postponed 8/10 episodes successfully. Urge dropped from average 70 to 25."

**Learning Options**:
- "I have more control than I believed"
- "Postponing is possible even with strong urges"
- "Many worries aren't important enough to remember"

### 2. Time-to-Refocus Drill

**Target Belief**: "Once I start worrying, I can't stop"

**Hypothesis**: If I can't stop, refocus time won't improve with practice.

**Protocol**:
```
Trials per day: 5
Days: 3

1. Notice worry starting
2. Start timer
3. Apply SAR immediately
4. Stop timer when refocused
5. Record seconds
```

**Metrics**:
- Day 1 average time (seconds)
- Day 3 average time (seconds)
- Improvement percentage
- Shortest time achieved

**Success Criteria**:
- Any reduction = Evidence of control
- >30% reduction = Strong evidence
- <60 seconds achieved = Skill acquired

**Common Outcome**: "Refocus time decreased from 180s to 45s average"

**Learning Options**:
- "I can stop worry faster with practice"
- "Attention is more flexible than I thought"
- "Quick refocusing is a learnable skill"

---

### 3. No-Monitoring Window

**Target Belief**: "If I don't monitor, I'll miss something dangerous"

**Hypothesis**: Not monitoring will lead to missing real dangers.

**Protocol**:
```
Monitoring-free windows:
- Monday: 9-11 AM (no body scanning)
- Tuesday: 2-4 PM (no news checking)
- Wednesday: 6-8 PM (no mental reviewing)

Track:
- Anxiety at start (0-100)
- Anxiety every 30 min
- Actual dangers missed
- Consequences experienced
```

**Metrics**:
- Number of real dangers missed (count)
- Negative consequences (list)
- Anxiety habituation curve
- Productivity during windows

**Typical Outcome**: "0 dangers missed, anxiety decreased, got more done"

**Learning Options**:
- "Monitoring doesn't prevent problems"
- "I notice important things without trying"
- "Less monitoring = less anxiety, same safety"

---

### 4. Checking Reduction Challenge

**Target Belief**: "I must check or something bad will happen"

**Hypothesis**: Reducing checking will lead to negative consequences.

**Protocol**:
```
Week 1: Baseline (track current checking)
Week 2: 50% reduction

Record:
- Urge intensity when resisting
- Time for urge to pass
- Actual problems from not checking
```

**Metrics**:
- Baseline vs reduced frequency
- Problems occurred (count)
- Average urge duration (minutes)
- Anxiety at day 1 vs day 5

**Common Outcome**: "Reduced email checking 60%, zero problems, urges passed in <10 min"

**Learning Options**:
- "Checking doesn't prevent problems"
- "Urges to check pass quickly"
- "I can function with less checking"

**Hypothesis**: Without reassurance, I won't be able to function.

**Protocol**:
```
72-hour challenge:
- No reassurance seeking from others

3. Apply DM and SAR
4. Rate urge 1 hour later
```

**Metrics**:
- Reassurance urges resisted (%)
- Average urge duration
- Function impact (0-10 daily)
- Problems from not seeking

**Typical Outcome**: "Resisted 14/16 urges, functioned normally, anxiety decreased"

**Learning Options**:
- "I can cope without reassurance"
- "Reassurance urges pass naturally"
- "Self-reliance feels better than dependence"

### 6. Plan-Then-Act vs Worry-First

**Target Belief**: "Worry helps me prepare better"

**Hypothesis**: Worry leads to better preparation than brief planning.

**Protocol**:
```
2 similar tasks/decisions:

Task A (Worry approach):
1. Worry for 10 minutes
2. Note actions generated
3. Execute actions
4. Rate: Preparedness (0-100), Distress (0-100)

Task B (Planning approach):
1. Plan for 2 minutes max
2. Note actions generated
3. Execute actions
4. Rate: Preparedness (0-100), Distress (0-100)
```

**Metrics**:
- Actions generated (count)
- Quality of outcomes
- Time spent (minutes)
- Distress levels
- Preparedness ratings

**Common Outcome**: "Planning: 3 actions in 2 min, felt 80% prepared. Worry: 1 action in 10 min, felt 60% prepared"

**Hypothesis**: Attention control is impossible during emotional activation.

**Protocol**:
```
When triggered:
1. Rate distress (0-100)

### 9. Allow-the-Thought Windows

**Target Belief**: "Having worry thoughts is dangerous"

**Hypothesis**: Allowing worry thoughts will lead to losing control.

**Protocol**:
```
2-minute windows, 3x daily:
1. Deliberately allow any worry thoughts
2. Don't engage or suppress
3. Just observe their presence
4. Rate at end:

   - Distress level (0-100)
   - What actually happened?
```

**Metrics**:

**Hypothesis**: Without this safety behavior, I won't manage.

**Protocol**:
```
Choose ONE safety behavior:
- Phone checking for reassurance
- Carrying medication "just in case"

When worry/rumination starts:
1. Set timer for 90 seconds
2. Note the topic (brief label only)
3. When timer rings, STOP
4. Apply SAR immediately

   - Did stopping cause problems?
   - Did it return as urgent?
```

**Metrics**:
- Episodes limited successfully (%)

## Experiment Design Principles

### Setting Up for Success

1. **Start with moderate challenges** (not easiest or hardest)
2. **Ensure genuine test** (not rigged for success)
3. **Multiple trials when possible** (not one-off)
4. **Clear metrics beforehand** (not retroactive)
5. **Time-bound** (specific duration)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall**: Making experiment too easy
**Solution**: Choose genuine challenges

**Pitfall**: Vague predictions
**Solution**: Use numbers and specifics

**Pitfall**: Not dropping safety behaviors
**Solution**: Explicitly list what to avoid

**Pitfall**: Changing protocol mid-experiment
**Solution**: Commit and complete as designed

**Pitfall**: Dismissing results
**Solution**: Data is data, even if surprising

## Experiment Sequencing

### Recommended Order

**Weeks 1-2**: Foundation
- Postponement Control Test
- Basic Time-to-Refocus

**Weeks 3-4**: Belief Challenging
- Plan vs Worry Comparison
- Uncontrollability tests

**Weeks 5-6**: Behavior Reduction
- Drop safety behaviors
- Checking/reassurance reduction

**Week 7**: Integration
- Stress Test Composite
- Custom experiments

### Customization Guidelines

**For High Anxiety**:
- Start with shorter durations
- More gradual reductions
- Focus on postponement first

**For Skeptics**:
- Begin with Time-to-Refocus (concrete)
- Use objective metrics heavily
- Emphasize data collection

**For Low Motivation**:
- Choose most bothersome behavior
- Quick wins first
- Shorter experiments
