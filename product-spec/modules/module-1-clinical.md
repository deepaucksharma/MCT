### Key Components

#### 1. Triggers (Not Focus of Intervention)
- **Definition**: External or internal events that activate metacognitive beliefs
- **Product approach**: Labeled but not analyzed
- **Examples tracked**: "Work", "Health", "Relationships", "Future"
- **Measurement**: Categories only, no content detail

#### 2. Metacognitive Beliefs (Primary Intervention Target)
- **Positive metacognitive beliefs**: Beliefs about the usefulness of worry/rumination
- **Negative metacognitive beliefs**: Beliefs about uncontrollability and danger
- **Product implementation**: 0-100 VAS ratings, tracked weekly

#### 3. CAS Components (Quantified Daily)
- **Perseverative thinking**: Worry and rumination
- **Attentional strategies**: Threat monitoring and checking
- **Thought control strategies**: Suppression, distraction, reassurance-seeking

## CAS Elements Quantification

### Worry and Rumination
**Definition**: Repetitive negative thinking about future (worry) or past (rumination)

**Measurement Protocol**:
- **Metric**: Minutes per day (0-120+ range)
- **Collection**: Daily log, evening entry
- **Prompt**: "How many minutes today did you spend worrying about the future?"
- **Validation**: Cross-check with postponement logs

**Target Reduction**:
- Week 1-2: Establish baseline
- Week 3-4: 10-15% reduction
- Week 5-8: 20-30% reduction sustained

### Threat Monitoring
**Definition**: Scanning internal/external environment for danger signals

**Types Tracked**:
1. **Body scanning**: Checking physical sensations
2. **Environmental scanning**: Checking news, social media for threats
3. **Mental scanning**: Reviewing thoughts for dangerous content

**Measurement Protocol**:
- **Metric**: Frequency count (0-20+ per day)
- **Collection**: Daily log
- **Prompt**: "How many times did you check your body/environment/thoughts for danger?"

**Target Reduction**:
- Week 2-3: Awareness building
- Week 4-5: 25% reduction
- Week 6-8: 40-50% reduction

### Unhelpful Coping Behaviors
**Definition**: Actions taken to manage perceived threat that maintain the problem

**Behaviors Tracked**:
1. **Checking** (emails, locks, symptoms): Count/day
2. **Reassurance-seeking** (from others): Count/day
3. **Avoidance** (situations, thoughts): Count/day
4. **Thought suppression** attempts: Count/day

**Measurement Protocol**:
- **Metric**: Individual behavior counts
- **Collection**: Daily log
- **Prompts**: Specific to each behavior type
- **Aggregation**: Total unhelpful coping score

## Metacognitive Beliefs Assessment

### Positive Metacognitive Beliefs
**Core beliefs tracked**:

1. **"Worry helps me prepare"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥15 point reduction

2. **"Thinking things through prevents bad outcomes"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥20 point reduction

3. **"If I don't worry, I'm being irresponsible"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥15 point reduction

4. **"Rumination helps me understand myself"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥15 point reduction

### Negative Metacognitive Beliefs

#### Uncontrollability Beliefs
1. **"My worry is uncontrollable"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥20 point reduction by Week 4-6

2. **"Once I start ruminating, I can't stop"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥15 point reduction

3. **"My mind has a will of its own"**

   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥15 point reduction

3. **"Not monitoring means missing danger"**
   - VAS: 0-100
   - Target: ≥20 point reduction

## Clinical Levers (Product Interventions)

### 1. Attentional Control Enhancement
**Mechanism**: Build flexible, voluntary attention control

**Interventions**:
- **ATT (Attention Training Technique)**
  - Selective attention: Focus on single sounds
  - Attention switching: Rapid shifts between sounds
  - Divided attention: Simultaneous awareness
  - Duration: 12-15 minutes daily

- **SAR (Situational Attentional Refocusing)**
  - If-Then implementation intentions
  - External focus anchors
  - Rapid deployment (<30 seconds)

**Measurement**:
- Post-ATT control rating (0-100)
- Time-to-refocus in triggers (seconds)
- Intrusion frequency during ATT

### 2. Metacognitive Mode Development
**Mechanism**: Shift from object mode to metacognitive mode

**Interventions**:
- **DM (Detached Mindfulness)**
  - Observe thoughts without engagement
  - Neither suppress nor elaborate
  - 60-180 second practices
  - 3+ times daily

**Key Components**:
1. **Awareness**: Notice the thought/feeling
2. **Detachment**: Step back mentally
3. **Allowing**: Let it be present without action
4. **Refocusing**: Return attention to chosen anchor

**Measurement**:
- Confidence to disengage (0-100)
- Engaged vs Watched self-report
- Practice frequency

### 3. Response Prevention/Delay
**Mechanism**: Break automatic CAS activation

**Interventions**:
- **Worry/Rumination Postponement**
  - Immediate labeling of episode
  - Schedule to designated time
  - Brief containment at scheduled slot
  - Track urge changes

**Protocol**:
1. Detect worry/rumination onset
2. Rate urge intensity (0-100)
3. Schedule to postponement slot
4. Apply SAR for immediate refocus
5. At slot: Re-rate urge, optional processing (10-15 min max)

**Measurement**:
- Postponement success rate (%)
- Urge reduction (detect→slot)
- Minutes in postponement slot

### 4. Behavioral Experiments
**Mechanism**: Generate experiential evidence against maladaptive beliefs

**Core Experiment Types**:
1. **Attention control experiments**: Prove ability to shift/control attention
2. **Postponement experiments**: Test controllability beliefs
3. **Drop safety behaviors**: Test danger beliefs
4. **Utility tests**: Compare worry vs planning outcomes

**Measurement**:
- Prediction accuracy
- Belief rating change pre→post
- Behavioral adherence

## Fidelity Rules

### Content vs Process Distinction

#### ALWAYS Process-Focused
✓ "Notice you're having a worry thought"
✓ "How long did you worry?"
✓ "Rate your ability to refocus"
✓ "Did you postpone the episode?"

#### NEVER Content-Focused
✗ "What were you worried about?"
✗ "Is that worry realistic?"
✗ "Let's problem-solve this"
✗ "Here's why that won't happen"

### Response to User Content

**If user provides content**:
- Response: "I notice you're sharing the content of your thoughts. In MCT, we focus on HOW you're relating to these thoughts, not WHAT they're about."

**If user seeks reassurance**:
- Response: "Seeking reassurance maintains the problem. Let's focus on postponing this worry and practicing your ATT."

**If user reports crisis**:
- Response: Immediate crisis resources + "This requires immediate professional support"

### Weekly Module Requirements

Every weekly module MUST include:
1. **Process-focused psychoeducation** (5-10 min)
2. **At least one belief-targeted experiment**
3. **Skill practice assignments** (ATT, DM, SAR)
4. **Belief re-rating** (minimum 3 beliefs)
5. **CAS metrics review** (no content discussion)

## Acceptance Criteria
