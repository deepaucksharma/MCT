# Module 0: Orientation and Strategic Positioning

## Purpose
Establish an MCT-true product proposition centered on changing the relationship to thoughts (process), reducing CAS (worry/rumination, threat monitoring), and modifying metacognitive beliefs (uncontrollability, danger, utility). Position the product for clinical adoption and potential Digital Therapeutics (DTx) pathways without delving into technical/regulatory engineering.

   - Worry/Rumination Postponement: Systematic delay and containment protocols
   - Situational Attentional Refocusing (SAR): If-Then implementation intentions
   - Metacognitive belief modification via behavioral experiments

2. **Provides structured 8-10 week arc with measurable, process-level outcomes**
   - Weekly psychoeducation modules (5-10 minutes reading time)
   - Graded skill introduction with practice scaffolding
   - Progressive belief challenging through experimentation
   - Clear milestone markers and progress indicators

3. **Uses low-burden, daily micro-practices and weekly experiments**
